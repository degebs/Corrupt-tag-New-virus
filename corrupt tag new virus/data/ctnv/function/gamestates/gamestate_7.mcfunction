# if a runner dies they should have only 1 tick to be at  "0" health... for multiple reasons
#1. should not be able to nautraly regenerate back into the game
#2. the previous bug that spams the chat and for some reason makes the shulker boxes visable
# the bug is still not fixed. a new function will be needed to work around this crap
# i wish i could just use the health variable to do this but no, it had to play the "fuck you" game
# for some reason if the runners health becomes 0 it may never go lower, and there no way to tell whats doing it
execute as @a[team=runners] if score @s health matches 0 run scoreboard players set @s health -1
# this one above may sometime not work, i cant find out why. so im developing a failsafe

# the fact that this bug is so inconsistent and unpredictable is so genuenly infuriating.
# one consequence of this bug is that sometimes properly "dying" may not be possible some games
